## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin to remove badges (such as
[`shields.io`][shields]).

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**remark** adds support for markdown to unified.
**mdast** is the markdown AST that remark uses.
This is a remark plugin that transforms mdast.

## When should I use this?

This package is useful when you’re taking (user generated) readmes, which
in the JavaScript community often have assorted badges, but want to display
them cleanly on a website or in a limited medium such as man pages.

A different plugin, [`remark-squeeze-paragraphs`][remark-squeeze-paragraphs],
can take care of potentially empty paragraphs left behind by this plugin.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-strip-badges
```

In Deno with [Skypack][]:

```js
import remarkStripBadges from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-strip-badges@6?dts'
```

In browsers with [Skypack][]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkStripBadges from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/remark-strip-badges@6?min'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
# remark-strip-badges ![Build Status][badge]

[badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/remarkjs/remark-strip-badges.svg
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkStripBadges from 'remark-strip-badges'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkStripBadges)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
# remark-strip-badges

[badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/remarkjs/remark-strip-badges.svg
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkStripBadges`.

### `unified().use(remarkStripBadges)`

Plugin to remove badges (such as [`shields.io`][shields]).
There are no options.

## Syntax

Any image (or image references) that references a known badge (see
[`is-badge`][is-badge]) will be removed.
If it occurs in a link, that link is also removed.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
There are no extra types exported.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This plugin works with `unified` version 3+ and `remark` version 4+.

## Security

Use of `remark-strip-badges` does not involve **[rehype][]** (**[hast][]**) or
user content so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attacks.
